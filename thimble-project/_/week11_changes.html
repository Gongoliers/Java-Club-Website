    <h3>Start touring our website here on our <a href = homePage.html>Home Page</a></h3>
    <h4>Javascript Requirements:</h4>
    <p>Chris filled his JavaScript requirements by creating the random image chooser on the media page, which is reponsible for displaying a random image on the page everytime the button is clicked. Brandon fufilled his JavaScript requirements by creating a countdown on the Calendar page, which counts down the amount of days until the next Java Club meeting.      
    </p>
    <h2>Changes:</h2>
    <h3>Changes to bioPage.html</h3>
    <p>There were not many changes to the bio page, once the content was added it became apparent that headers would be benefitial so they were added. Besides this everything is the same as the original plan.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to calendarPage.html</h3>
    <p>The main change here was the removal of a calendar image along with the addition of a JavaScript application that counts down the amount of days until the next meeting for the club.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to creatorsPage.html</h3>
    <p>There were no changes to the design of the creators page.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to hardwarePage.html</h3>
    <p>There were no changes to the design of the hardware page.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to homePage.html</h3>
    <p>There were no changes to the home page excluding the format choice of bolding the name of each page.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to index.html</h3>
    <p>This page was not originially in the design but was added to be a copy of the home page so Thimble would go there automatically. It is used until the user goes to a different page, during which they can no longer access index.html.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to mediaPage.html</h3>
    <p>The idea of the media page is the same though there have been several changes. Instead of there being a gallery there is a button which can be pressed which will display a random image we used on the website. Along with this, we removed the description as it did not seem as though it was needed.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to programPage.html</h3>
    <p>The only change to the program page was its format, putting the description above the code instead of to the side of it in order to make it easier to read.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to programsPlus.html</h3>
    <p>There were several changes to the programs+ page, mainly putting the code descriptions above the code and using one video that can be used for all the code on the page.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to README.html</h3>
    <p>This was created as a simple readme for the project, though it wasn't in the original design it was added in to give a bit of background for anyone looking through the code of the website.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to images folder</h3>
    <p>All the images were found through the course of the project to use somewhere in it, excluding the stock image which was used as a filler while we were aquiring more images. Originally it wasn't planned to have the folder though it was necessary for organizational purposes.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to videos folder</h3>
    <p>We created a place to store videos instead of just leaving them in the project, though we only had one video.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to CSS styling</h3>
    <p>There were no changes to the original styling, excluding a few headings being bolded here and there.
