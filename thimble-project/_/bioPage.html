  <p class = "fontCourier">The Ponaganset High School (PHS) Java Club was created 4 years ago by Kyle Corry in order to offer the ability to learn about programming to PHS students and anyone else who was interested. It has since been maintained by Christopher Vieira and is soon to be handed off to Seth Drexler and Nicholas Bottone. This Club serves a crucial role for the school’s FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team 5112 “The Gongoliers”, as all their programmers participate in the club and this is where they learn how to the program the FRC robots. The club starts off the year working on the basics of Java such as types of variables and the use of methods but has recently become more involved with FRC programming. This year especially, the group has been creating FRC programs for the majority of their classes before the FRC build season began. Though the club is trying to teach its members how to complete certain programming tasks, it is also important that the younger members have input into what is being done. The club teachers members by having one member display his screen on all of the other members screens and create a program. Every other member will create the same program on their computer to gain the experience, but it is not just copying down line after line. The students have input on whether they feel an element of the program should be changed and have exercised that frequently. This allows them to gain the experience of working on a program with a group while at the same time strengthening their knowledge of the basics.</p>
  <h3 id = "bioHeaders">Kyle Corry:</h3>
  <p class = "fontCourier">While being the Director of the Programming and Controls department on FRC team 5112, Kyle Corrye formed the club in order to spread his knowledge of programming to others. This started with basic Java in Netbeans and then transformed into more advanced Java along with a bit of FRC programming during the second year of the club. Thanks to Kyle there is an existing club which both teachers members of Ponaganset High School programming along with providing the programming members of the FRC team a resource to learn Java through. He is currently attending WPI for Computer Science.</p>
  <h3 id = "bioHeaders">Christopher Vieira:</h3>
  <p class = "fontCourier">The current director of programming and controls, Christopher Vieira, has maintained the club since Kyle Corry has left. Over the past few years they have maintained teaching the basics but also focused much more on creating programs for the FRC to demonstrate creating a program from scratch. He will also be attending WPI for Computer Science come Fall of 2018.</p>
  <h3 id = "bioHeaders">Seth Drexler and Nicholas Bottone:</h3>
  <p class = "fontCourier">Seth Drexler and Nicholas Bottone, the future Assistant Director of Programming and Controls and Director of Programming and Controls respectively, will take over the club once Christopher graduates. They have been acting as assistants in the class, acting more as teacher assistants than students. For the next two years they will be taking over the club until they eventually pass it on to others as dedicated as each of them.</p>
