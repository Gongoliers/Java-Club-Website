  <p class = "fontCourier">One of the creators is Brandon Carvalho. He is currently a senior at Case High School and plans on attending PC to major in Computer Science. Another creator of the website is Christopher Vieira. He is currently a senior at Ponaganset High School and plans on attending WPI to major in Computer Science.</p>
  
  <p class = "fontCourier">This website is created for an assignment for our Web Design VHS course. It requires us to create a website for an organization, club, company, or any other group that would require a website. As you can probably tell at this point, we chose to make a website for Ponaganset High School's Java Club. This was mainly possible through one of the creators being a leader on the club for the past two years.</p>
    
  <p class = "fontCourier">The Web Design VHS course focused on teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a half year course and a great opportunity to learn more about creating websites.</p>
