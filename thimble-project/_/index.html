    <p class = "fontCourier">The Ponaganset High School (PHS) Java Club was created 4 years ago by Kyle Corry in order to offer the ability to learn about programming to PHS students and anyone else who was interested. It has since been maintained by Christopher Vieira and is soon to be handed off to Seth Drexler and Nicholas Bottone. This Club serves a crucial role for the school’s FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team 5112 “The Gongoliers”, as all their programmers participate in the club and this is where they learn how to the program the FRC robots.</p>
